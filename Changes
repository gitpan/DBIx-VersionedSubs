    * The code now gets put not only into the right package
      but it also gets compiled with the right package, so
      BEGIN{...} blocks can be used to declare variables.
    * Added tests for syntax errors in blocks
    * Added tests for strict errors in blocks
    * Added tests for __PACKAGE__

    * ::AutoLoad didn't remove subroutines that had
      expired. This bug remains open but there is a
      workaround in place which replaces changed subs
      with code that re-fires AUTOLOAD.

0.03 20060804
    * Added AutoLoad.pm which does lazy loading of code
      instead of loading all of the code all of the time
    * Added tests for AutoLoad.pm which ensure that the
      behaviour is identical across the two versions
      except where it isn't.

0.02 20060726
    * Added SEE ALSO and ALTERNATIVE NAMES sections, credited Tye for the name

    * No functional changes in the main code
    * Added more pod discussing the database tables
